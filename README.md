This report examines the gender wage gap in Chile using data from the CASEN 2022 survey, a nationally representative household survey conducted by the Chilean government to assess socioeconomic conditions, including income, employment, and education. The objective of this study is to quantify wage disparities between men and women and identify the key factors contributing to these differences. The analysis involves descriptive statistics, clustering methods, a Tobit II regression models (to control for selection bias), and finally an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. 
The findings confirm the presence of a significant gender wage gap, even after controlling for education, experience, and sector of employment. The study concludes that structural factors, including labor market segmentation and discrimination, contribute to persistent wage inequalities, underscoring the need for targeted policy interventions.
